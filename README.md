# weather_app

## Description

For this project, i was tasked to create a weather app that gives the forecast for the current day and the next 5 days in a particular city. For this app I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript and API.
When a user searches for a city they can see the current and future forecast for that city. Afterwards the city is added to the search history.
